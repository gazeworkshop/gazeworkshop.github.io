    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
The 3rd International Workshop on Gaze Estimation and Prediction in the Wild (GAZE 2021) at <a href="http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/" target="_blank">CVPR 2021</a> aims to encourage and highlight novel strategies for eye gaze estimation and prediction with a focus on robustness and accuracy in extended parameter spaces, both spatially and temporally.
This is expected to be achieved by applying novel neural network architectures, incorporating anatomical insights and constraints, introducing new and challenging datasets, and exploiting multi-modal training.
Specifically, the workshop topics include (but are not limited to):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reformulating eye detection, gaze estimation, and gaze prediction pipelines with deep networks.</li>
      <li>Applying geometric and anatomical constraints into the training of (sparse or dense) deep networks.</li>
      <li>Leveraging additional cues such as contexts from face region and head pose information.</li>
      <li>Developing adversarial methods to deal with conditions where current methods fail (illumination, appearance, etc.).</li>
      <li>Exploring attention mechanisms to predict the point of regard.</li>
      <li>Designing new accurate measures to account for rapid eye gaze movement.</li>
      <li>Novel methods for temporal gaze estimation and prediction including Bayesian methods.</li>
      <li>Integrating differentiable components into 3D gaze estimation frameworks.</li>
      <li>Robust estimation from different data modalities such as RGB, depth, head pose, and eye region landmarks.</li>
      <li>Generic gaze estimation method for handling extreme head poses and gaze directions.</li>
      <li>Temporal information usage for eye tracking to provide consistent gaze estimation on the screen.</li>
      <li>Personalization of gaze estimators with few-shot learning.</li>
      <li>Semi-/weak-/un-/self- supervised leraning methods, domain adaptation methods, and other novel methods towards improved representation learning from eye/face region images or gaze target region images.</li>
    </ul>
We will be hosting 3 invited speakers and holding 2 deep learning challenges for the topic of gaze estimation. We will also be accepting the submission of full unpublished papers as done in previous versions of the workshop. These papers will be peer-reviewed via a double-blind process, and will be published in the official workshop proceedings and be presented at the workshop itself. More information will be provided as soon as possible.

The extended abstracts will not be published or made available to the public (we will only list titles on our website) but will rather be presented during our poster session. We see this as an opportunity for authors to promote their work to an interested audience to gather valuable feedback.

Dr. Rehg serves on the Editorial Board of the Intl. J. of Computer Vision, and he served as the General co-Chair for CVPR 2009 and is serving as the Program co-Chair for CVPR 2017 (Puerto Rico). He has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific papers and holds 23 issued US patents. Dr. Rehg&#8217;s research interests include computer vision, machine learning, behavioral imaging, and mobile health (mHealth). He is the Deputy Director of the NIH Center of Excellence on Mobile Sensor Data-to-Knowledge (<a href="http://md2k.org" target="_blank">MD2K</a>), which is developing novel on-body sensing and predictive analytics for improving health outcomes. Dr. Rehg is also leading a multi-institution effort, funded by an NSF Expedition award, to develop the science and technology of <a href="http://www.cbs.gatech.edu" target="_blank">Behavioral Imaging</a>— the capture and analysis of social and communicative behavior using multi-modal sensing, to support the study and treatment of developmental disorders such as autism.

	<h3>Development of hybrid eye tracking systems for studies of neuropsychiatric disorders.</h3><br />
	<b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">
	Visual scanning behaviour is controlled by both low-level perception processes (e.g., colour, spatial characteristics of the visual stimuli) and high-level cognitive processes, which are driven by memories, emotions, expectations, and goals. During natural viewing subjects are unaware of their visual scanning behaviour and as such visual scanning behaviour can provide physiological markers for objective evaluation of cognitive processes in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.
	</p>
	<p class="speaker-abstract">
In this talk I will present our past and current work towards the development of objective markers for neuropsychiatric disorders. This work includes both the development of new methods to analyse visual scanning patterns and the development of eye-tracking systems to monitor such patterns.
	</p>
	<p class="speaker-abstract">
I will start by describing a general method for the analysis of visual scanning behaviour in neuropsychiatric disorders. I will then demonstrate the utility of this novel method by providing examples from our studies in patients with eating and mood disorders. I will then describe two low cost eye-tracking systems that we developed for such studies. One system uses a smartphone to display visual stimuli and analyse visual scanning patterns while the other uses a virtual reality headset to display visual stimuli. Point-of-gaze, in both systems, is computed by an eye-model whose parameters are estimated from eye-images by machine learning techniques (i.e., a hybrid approach to point-of-gaze estimation).

	<b>Abstract</b><p class="speaker-abstract">
	In order to understand actions or anticipate intentions, humans need efficient ways of gathering information about each other. In particular, gaze is a rich source of information about other peoples’ activities and intentions. In this talk, we describe our work on predicting human gaze. We introduce a series of methods to follow gaze for different modalities. First, we present GazeFollow, a dataset and model to predict the location of people's gaze in an image. Furthermore, we introduce Gaze360, a large-scale gaze-tracking dataset and method for robust 3D gaze direction estimation in unconstrained scenes. Finally, we also propose a saliency-based sampling layer designed to improve performance in arbitrary tasks by efficiently zooming into the relevant parts of the input image.
