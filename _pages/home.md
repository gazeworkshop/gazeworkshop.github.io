    <p>
The 1st Workshop on Gaze Estimation and Prediction in the Wild (GAZE 2019) at ICCV 2019 is a first-of-its-kind workshop focused on designing and evaluating deep learning methods for the task of gaze estimation and prediction. We aim to encourage and highlight novel strategies with a focus on robustness and accuracy in natural in-the-wild settings. This is expected to be achieved via novel neural network architectures, incorporating anatomical insights and constraints, introducing new and challenging datasets, and exploiting multi-modal training among other directions. This half-day workshop consists of three invited talks as well as lightning talks from industry contributors.

      <b><a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/aliaga/">Daniel Aliaga</a></b> does research primarily in the area of 3D computer graphics but overlaps with computer vision and visualization while also having strong multi-disciplinary collaborations outside of computer science. His research activities are divided into three groups: a) his pioneering work in the multi-disciplinary area of inverse modeling and design; b) his first-of-its-kind work in codifying information into images and surfaces, and c) his compelling work in a visual computing framework including high-quality 3D acquisition methods. Dr. Aliaga’s inverse modeling and design is particularly focused at digital city planning applications that provide innovative “what-if” design tools enabling urban stake holders from cities worldwide to automatically integrate, process, analyze, and visualize the complex interdependencies between the urban form, function, and the natural environment.
