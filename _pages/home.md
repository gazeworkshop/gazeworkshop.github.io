    <p>
The 1st Workshop on Gaze Estimation and Prediction in the Wild (GAZE 2019) at <a href="http://iccv2019.thecvf.com/program/workshops" target="_blank">ICCV 2019</a> is the first-of-its-kind workshop focused on designing and evaluating deep learning methods for the task of gaze estimation and prediction. We aim to encourage and highlight novel strategies with a focus on robustness and accuracy in real-world settings. This is expected to be achieved via novel neural network architectures, incorporating anatomical insights and constraints, introducing new and challenging datasets, and exploiting multi-modal training among other directions. This half-day workshop consists of three invited talks as well as talks from industry contributors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The topics of this workshop include but are not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Proposal of novel eye detection, gaze estimation, and gaze prediction pipelines using deep convolutional neural networks.</li>
      <li>Incorporating geometric and anatomical constraints into neural networks in a differentiable manner.</li>

    <h3>Appearance-based Gaze Estimation: What We Have Done and What We Should Do</h3>
    <br>
    <b>Abstract</b>
    <p class="speaker-abstract">
    Since its first appearance in the 90s, appearance-based gaze
    estimation has been gradually but steadily gaining attention until
    now. This talk aims at providing a brief overview of past research
    achievements in the area of appearance-based gaze estimation, mainly
    from the perspective of both personalization and generalization
    techniques. I will also discuss some remaining challenges towards the
    ultimate goal of camera-based versatile gaze estimation techniques.

    <h3>Measuring attention in  interactions: from context based multimodal head pose analysis to 3D gaze estimation</h3>
    <br>
    <b>Abstract</b>
    <p class="speaker-abstract">
Beyond words, non-verbal behaviors (NVB) are known to play important roles in face-to-face interactions. However, decoding non-verbal behaviors is a challenging problem that involves both extracting subtle physical NVB cues and mapping them to higher-level communication behaviors or social constructs. This is particularly the case of gaze, one of the most important non-verbal behaviors with functions related to communication and social signaling.
<br>
<br>
In this talk, I will present our past and current work towards the automatic analysis of attention (whether 3D gaze or its discrete version the Visual Focus of Attention, VFOA)  in situations where large user mobility is expected and minimal intrusion is required. I will first introduce how we addressed VFOA recognition in meetings using Dynamical Bayesian Networks to jointly model speech conversation, gaze (represented by head pose), and task context. I will then present recent methods investigated to perform 3D gaze tracking, including robust and accurate 3D head pose tracking under 360 degrees as well as the use of several deep neural network architectures for  appearance-based gaze estimation. The latter will include methods to build personalized models through few-shot learning and gaze redirection eye synthesis, differential gaze estimation, and online learning or adaptation, potentially taking advantage of priors on social interactions to obtain weak labels for model adaptation.

    <h3>Gaze into the future</h3>
    <br>
    <b>Abstract</b>
    <p class="speaker-abstract">
Just a few years ago, eye tracking was still considered a research tool and a niche product used for e.g. offering people with assistive needs a voice. Today, however, eye tracking is broadcasted on major sports gaming tournaments and has become integrated into commercial off-the-shelf PCs and VR headsets.
<br>
A major pull for eye tracking technology today comes from the XR space. While eye tracking already now adds value to current XR products, future XR hardware, such as e.g. dynamic focus displays, simply won’t work without refined eye tracking solutions. In this talk we’ll describe what role eye tracking will play in future remote and near eye setups and where eye tracking simply needs to succeed.
    </p>
    <b>Biography</b>
    <p class="speaker-bio">Maria has been working with software and algorithm development for more than 15 years. During her career she has held a variety of roles from developer to research lead at companies like Philips, Infineon and Saab. Maria joined Tobii’s eye tracking algorithm team in 2015 as a Key Algorithm Engineer.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker-bio" id="awards">An eye tracker that works for every single individual is still a challenge. Maria has experienced from close how PC eye tracking has moved from being a specialty market and research tool to a mainstream gaming equipment. She has also been closely involved in the development of eye tracking for VR and AR, and been part of the work behind releasing products such as the <a href="https://vr.tobii.com/products/htc-vive-pro-eye/" target="_blank">HTC Vive Pro Eye</a>.
